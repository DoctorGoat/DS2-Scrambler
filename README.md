# DS2-Scrambler

Randomizes game params in Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin.

Inspired by TKGP's [Irregulator](https://github.com/JKAnderson/Irregulator) for DS3 and Mechapope's [Paramdomizer](https://github.com/Mechapope/Paramdomizer) for DS1.

Supports:
* Treasure randomisation
* Weapon randomisation
* Armor randomisation

# Usage
1. Run the application.
2. Select the mod folder you wish to scramble. For example: *C:\Users\Name\Documents\Fromsoft\MyMod*
3. Toggle the scramble settings as you wish, each type of scrambling can be toggled on or off.
4. Press Scramble. A new mod scalled *MyMod-Scrambled* will be created in the same directory as *MyMod*.

To run the mod, I recommend you use ModEngine.
