# DS2-Scrambler

Randomizes game params in Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin.

Supports randomisation of various game parameters, such as enemies, treasures, etc. 

The scrambler is very configurable, and any number of options may be used to produce a scrambled mod.

# Usage
1. Run the application.
2. Select the mod folder you wish to scramble. For example: *C:\Users\Name\Documents\Fromsoft\MyMod*
3. Toggle the scramble settings as you wish, each type of scrambling can be toggled on or off.
4. Press Scramble. A new mod scalled *MyMod-Scrambled* will be created in the same directory as *MyMod*.

To run the mod, I recommend you use ModEngine.

# Warning
The scrambler attempts to blend chaos with stability, but some randomisation options such as *Generate Attributes* and *Enforce Visuals* for Projectiles may lead to crashes. 

If a crash occurs, you can re-use the Scrambler to produce a new set of randomised params, disabling any options you suspect caused the crash, and then continue the same playthrough.
