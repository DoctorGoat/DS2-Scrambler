# DS2-Scrambler

An item, enemy and param randomiser for Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin.

Supports various options for each of the three core randomisers, allowing for the user to select which aspects to randomise, and how the randomisation should occur.

# Usage
1. Run the application.
2. Select the mod folder you wish to scramble. For example: *C:\Users\Name\Documents\Fromsoft\MyMod*
3. Toggle the scramble settings as you wish, each type of scrambling can be toggled on or off.
4. Press Scramble. A new mod called *MyMod-Scrambled* will be created in the same directory as *MyMod*.

To run the mod, I recommend you use ModEngine.
